## Headline:
Hello, My name is Humberto Hernandez. I’m a frontend developer and overall a problem-solving wizard!

## Bio:
I am a frontend developer and currently a student at Thinkful Bootcamp for software engineering. My passion for coding stems from my experiences in tinkering with all aspects of technology from my childhood to the present day! Whether fixing VHS players, repairing circuit boards, or programming, I have always been enthusiastic about breaking down technology to understand it and figuring out how to fix it or improve it. Solving problems is what continues to motivate me whether that be a simple issue or something complex like learning different programming languages.

My personal interests not related to technology include astronomy, video games, and Schutzhund (Training dogs for protection). Additionally, I enjoy reading about military history and studying various military strategies from ancient times to the current day. 
When I need to get outside or release stress I enjoy rowing, mountain biking, or hiking.
